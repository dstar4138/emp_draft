Intro:
  I included this file so that those that learn better from example can get a 
little bit of background information on how this attachment was made. Its here
to give a much more in-depth look at the design of ExecAlarm.

  First off, ExecAlarm is the least complicated Alarm attachment EMP has. This
means that any other functionality that you would require could be build off
the platform ExecAlarm is based on.

Design:

  Alarms have two parts, the attachment and the alert. The attachment is what 
is attached to EMP upon startup and runs all commands. The alert is what 
handles the response to the event caused elsewhere within EMP. 

  Attachments are what spawn alarms, a good way of thinking about it is the 
following:
	'Alarms have different methods of alerting based on they type of event.'
This means that a single attachment could have anywhere from 1 to 100 different
ways of alerting. However most of these ways are utilizing a single method. Thats
where the different types of alarms comes into play.
