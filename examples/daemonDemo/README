# This is a demonstration of how to run and setup a daemon and talk to it using
# the SMTG daemonipc. This is never needed for plugins or interfaces, just use 
# the API for that. Instead this is for people that want to write their own 
# daemons for other projects.
# 


To run this demo you will need two terminals, in the first, run the daemon:
	./tmpDaemon.py
then in the second, run the interface:
	./tmpInterface.py
	
OUTPUT:	
You should get on the daemon side something similar to:
	key:  i 
	id:  00000002
	received interface connection - id: 00000002
	id( 00000002 )= info
	id( 00000002 )= info
	...
	
Then on the interface side something like:
	SERVER STATUS: Running...
	Interface id:00000002
	Been running since: Thu Feb  3 15:26:17 2011
	
	SERVER STATUS: Running...
	Interface id:00000002
	Been running since: Thu Feb  3 15:26:17 2011
	...
	
If there are any errors regarding issues seeing the smtg library, move the files 
into the src directory of smtg.
