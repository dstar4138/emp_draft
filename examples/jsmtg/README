# Java Interface for SMTG
# by Alexander Dean
#
In here are some examples of other languages interfacing with SMTG, using the 
InterfaceAPI. To get an example for plugins, please see the PluginAPI portion.


These are written in java: 
jsmtg.java     is a GUI example that can be used to test you daemon 
               communications. It presents the communication like a chat window
               to make it easyer to see.


jsmtg_t.java   is a simpler example without a GUI and can be used to visualize 
               the steps it takes to get the interface connected and
               communicating with SMTG.
