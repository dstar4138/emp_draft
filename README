# SMTG: Social Monitor for the Terminal Geek

SMTG is essentially a foundation for monitoring whatever your heart desires. At
its core SMTG is a feed reader, which means it runs off a standard feed loop. 
This feed loop can be used to pull data from feeds on an interval.

SMTG does one better than that though. It allows you to not only add those feeds 
but create plug-ins that act as feeds. They can be programmed by anyone with any 
language and can be used for anything from monitoring your pet to sending text 
messages automatically on special events. SMTG can even bypass this feed loop 
if an immediate alert needs to take place through a different type of plug-in.
