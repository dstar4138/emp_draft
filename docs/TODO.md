# TODO: #  

If you want to help contribute, try to tackle some of the issues still open on 
this TODO list. They are in no particular order, and some are going to be 
definitely more time consuming...

* Finish the plugs that are started!
* Finish the alarms that are started!
* Write the 'curses' interface for emp.py.
* Fix defaults for other operating system types.
* Add capability for an attachment to be both an alarm and a plug.
* Update documentation, once everything has been more formalized.

### Currently being worked on: ###

* Add functionality for requesting alert methods in plugs or vice-versa.
* Speeding up message passing through a new command structure.
* Documentation everywhere. 
* Events need to be customizable and adjustable!
