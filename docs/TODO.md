# TODO: #  

If you want to help contribute, try to tackle some of the issues still open on 
this TODO list. They are in no particular order, and some are going to be 
definitely more time consuming...

* Finish the plug-ins added to the plugins directory
* Finish the alarms added to the alarms directory
* Add more methods of alarming.
* Write the 'curses' interface for emp.py.
* Fix defaults for other operating system types.


### Currently being worked on: ###

* Add functionality for requesting alert methods in plug-ins or vice-versa
* Speeding up message passing through a new command structure
* Documentation everywhere. 
* Formalizing a nice document with the EMP API for Attachments and Interfaces.
* Adding capability for an attachment to be both an alarm and a plug.
